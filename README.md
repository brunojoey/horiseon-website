# horiseon-website

I got rid of the span container seperating hori, seo, and n from line 15, since it was unnecessary.

I got rid of the unordered list tag of the links class in line 16, since it felt unnecessary.

I added alt tags to all images: line 28, line 33, 38, 47, 52, and 57.

I changed search engine optimization, line 27, to an ID then created a class of the same name within that ID to correctly link to the header a tag it was targeting in line 17.

I changed "Made with 'heart' by Horiseon to an h3 to have all headings be in descending order.
